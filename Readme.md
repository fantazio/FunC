#FunC
A functionally oriented C library. This is ought to contain basic elements
of most functional languages such as linked lists, map, fold/reduce, ...


##How do I use it?
If you want to compile it, you will need `gcc` or `clang`.
A makefile exists. To use it you will need `make`.

- `make` group the sources in the **func** folder
- `make check` will make and run tests

To use this library in your projects, add the generated folder to your project
and add the header **<path>/func/func.h** where necessary
(with <path>, the path to the folder func).


##Goal
Add fun to C.
The intent is to improve my skills in C, focusing on macros, function pointers
and memory management.
