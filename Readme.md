#FunC
A functionally oriented C library. This is ought to contain basic elements
of most functional languages such as linked lists, map, fold/reduce, ...


##How do I use it?
If you want to compile it, you will need 'gcc' or 'clang'.
A makefile exists. To use it you will need 'make'.

- `make` will get you the **func.a** library
- `make check` will make and run tests

to use this library in your projects, link it while compiling your project
and add the header (**func.h**) where necessary.


##Goal
Add fun to C.
The intent is to improve my skills in C, focusing on pointers to functions,
memory management and macros.


##How do I contribute?
As the goal for me is to learn things, I would prefer to do the entire project
by myself. However, having someone participating can be instructive, this is
why some other people could sometimes join in.
